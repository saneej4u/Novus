In those days there would be as many as a billion&mdash;a  crab-shell, please&mdash;as many as that crab-shell in one man's body. We  called germs micro-organisms. When a few million, or a billion, of them  were in a man, in all the blood of a man, he was sick. These germs were  a disease. There were many different kinds of them&mdash;more different kinds  than there are grains of sand on this beach. We knew only a few of the  kinds. The micro-organic world was an invisible world, a world we could  not see, and we knew very little about it. Yet we did know something.  There was the bacillus anthracis; there was the micrococcus; there  was the Bacterium termo, and the Bacterium lactis&mdash;that's what  turns the goat milk sour even to this day, Hare-Lip; and there were  Schizomycetes without end. And there were many others...."</p>
